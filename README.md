# Nearness-Intellijel 1U

![Nearness Intellijel 1u](pictures/PCB and front plate.jpg)

This is an adaption of [sonocircuit's nearness module 1u adaptation](https://github.com/sonocircuit/Nearness-1U) (Which itself is an 1u adaptation of [sarnesjo's nearness module](https://github.com/sarnesjo/nearness)) now in 1U Intellijel format. 

### Changes made:

- The back PCB is now 22.5mm high to fit Intellijel's spec
- Rearranged jacks, new faceplate
- 14hp

## Making your own

WARNING: I haven't yet assembled one of these to test it, there may be errors in and or all components of this. Build at your own risk!

WARNING: Watch out for the 3 pin header. It has to be soldered before the jacks, otherwise it's pads are inaccessible. You'll also want to trim its leads so they don't stick too far out the back of the PCB. It's best if the resulting solder mound is flat or recessed, otherwise it risks shorting out in the jack and/or the jack not sitting flat.
